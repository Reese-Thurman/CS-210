# CS-210
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
> This is a C++ project that reads and analyzes a text file containing purchase records from a grocery store. The program uses data from the text file to display how frequently different food items are purchased. The analysis is displayed using both text and a histogram. This program allows grocery stores to determine which items are purchased most frequently in order to allow them to stock their stores appropriately.
2. What did you do particularly well?
> The best feature of the program is the modular design that divides the code into six primary, distinct functions.
3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
> The code could be enhanced by creating a header file to separate some of the code into different files. This will enhance the efficiency of the code by making it easier to read, more modular, and easier to update. 
4. 	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
> The most challenging part of the code was the creation of classes. I overcame this challenge by reviewing the website w3schools, which offers tutorials on C++ programming. I will continue to use this resource as a part of my support network.
5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
> The primary skill that will be transferrable to other course work is the ability to create and use objects in programs. Object-oriented programming is an important skill that improves the efficiency of code.
6. 	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
> I ensured the program was maintainable, readable, and adaptable by including inline comments, distinct functions, and little no code in the main function.
